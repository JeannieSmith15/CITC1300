         <h1>History & Visiting Information</h1>
         <p>The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States in 1886, celebrating the centennial of American independence and the enduring friendship between the two nations. Designed by French sculptor Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi, with engineering support from Gustave Eiffel, the statue stands 305 feet (93 meters) from base to torch.</p>

        <h2>A Gift with a Powerful Message</h2>
        <p>The idea for the Statue of Liberty was born in the 1860s when French historian √âdouard de Laboulaye proposed creating a monument to celebrate democracy and freedom in the U.S. French sculptor Fr√©d√©ric Auguste Bartholdi designed the statue, and Gustave Eiffel (yes, the same genius behind the Eiffel Tower) engineered its internal iron framework.</p>
