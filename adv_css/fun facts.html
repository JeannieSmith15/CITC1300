        <p>The Statue of Liberty, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, stands proudly on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. A gift from France in 1886, Lady Liberty symbolizes freedom and democracy. She is made of copper, and though she originally had a shiny brown color, years of oxidation turned her the famous green patina we see today</p>

        <p>Lady Liberty is full of hidden details and symbolism. Her torch, coated in 24-karat gold, represents enlightenment, while her crown has seven spikes, symbolizing the seven continents and seven seas of the world. In her left hand, she holds a tablet inscribed with "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" (July 4, 1776)—the date of the American Declaration of Independence. At her feet, broken chains and shackles signify the end of oppression and tyranny. Few people know that she also served as a lighthouse from 1886 to 1902, helping guide ships into New York Harbor!</p>

        <h3 class=" heading_style" >Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Her Face Was Modeled After the Sculptor’s Mother – Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the statue’s designer, is said to have used his mother’s face as inspiration for Lady Liberty.</li>

            <li> She Was Almost a Different Color – When first unveiled in 1886, she was reddish-brown (like a new penny) due to her copper exterior. Over 20 years, she oxidized and turned green. People debated whether to restore her original color, but the green patina was left intact.</li>

            <li>A Gift from France – The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States in 1886 to celebrate 100 years of American independence and the friendship between the two nations.</li>
