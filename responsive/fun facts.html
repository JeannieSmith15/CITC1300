        <p>Designed by the talented sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, it was engineered by Gustave Eiffel, the mastermind behind the Eiffel Tower. The statue’s official name, "Liberty Enlightening the World," encapsulates its role as a beacon of hope and inspiration. It was constructed in France, disassembled, and then shipped to the United States in over 300 individual pieces before being reassembled on Liberty Island.</p>
