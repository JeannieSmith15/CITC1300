            <p>The statue holds a torch in her right hand, symbolizing enlightenment, while her left hand carries a tablet inscribed with "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" (July 4, 1776), marking the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The broken chains at her feet represent the abolition of oppression and tyranny.</p>

            <p>Dedicated on October 28, 1886, by President Grover Cleveland, the Statue of Liberty quickly became a powerful beacon of hope, especially for millions of immigrants arriving in the United States through nearby Ellis Island. In 1924, it was designated a national monument, and in 1984, it was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its cultural and historical significance.</p>
