            <h2 class="heading_style">: Eiffel Tower at Night</h2>
            

            <p>As the sun sets, the Eiffel Tower transforms into a dazzling light show. Every evening, from sunset to 1 AM, 20,000 twinkling lights illuminate the structure for five minutes every hour. This spectacle attracts thousands of spectators and adds to the tower’s romantic appeal. However, professional photography of the tower at night requires permission due to copyright laws on the light display.</p>
